'''Plan:
You wake up in a cold stone cell. There are 2 doors, 1 is a staircase down and 1 is a hallway. both are lit
DOWN or UP
    DOWN
    it gets colder and there aren't any lights. Do you RETURN or CONTINUE?
        RETURN
        you are now in a different room with a staircase leading up.
        as you head up the the staircase the air grows warmer around you
        at the top you meet a man who's entirely engulfed in flame. He asks why you're here, do you FIGHT or REASON
            FIGHT
            you died

            REASON
            the man is very understanding, helps warm your hand, and shows you the exit.

        CONTINUE
        you descend deeper and after a bend you see a light up ahead. 
        upon reaching the light you find a room with food and a candle.
        there is another path continuing through the room though. EXPLORE or STAY?
            STAY
            you are warm, you are happy, and you fall asleep to the delicious scent of bread baking never to wake again.

            EXPLORE
            you push bravely forwards into the next hallway. It twists and turns but you keep your hand on the wall so as to not get lost. 
            hours later the ever-increasing cold and mind-bending passageways bring you to your knees, then to the ground. So cold...
            so cold...
    UP
    you pass a few other empty rooms like yours, none with windows. Eventually you reach a hall in which there's a great feast being held. 
    you are invited to stay and eat by many jolly strangers, begging you to enjoy the feast. do you STAY or LEAVE
        STAY
        there are only 3 foods in the entire banquet hall, even though hundreds are dining. Huge platters full of chicken and ornate goblets of wine, 
        as well as periodic small bowls of carefully cleaned pomegranate. "The fruit is delicious! Come, eat!"
        do you eat FRUIT or CHICKEN?
